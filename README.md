# Objective 

Since there have been more and more incidents of women being harassed in the recent past, girls need to think twice before going out of their houses. To insure their safety we developed an Android-based automated system to detect danger for women and children using audio from the surroundings. As the Android phone is available to everyone nowadays, they focused on using this device rather than developing a system on some external hardware. Different signal processing methods with deep learning techniques are used for this work. This work also addresses noise from the environment for any chaos and nullifies them using different noise reduction techniques. For this application, we used a Butterworth high-pass filter. The Android application also takes necessary action based on the setting when any unfavorable situation is detected. Android device users can use this application without any cost, which will pave the way to ensure the safety of women and children.
